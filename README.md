    1. Totals are not available for these results due to suppression constraints. More Information:

    2. Rows with suppressed Deaths are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show suppressed rows.

    Caveats:
    1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision.
    2. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of
    death code R99, "Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality." Caution should be used in interpreting these data.
    More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies.
    3. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code
    R99, "Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,
    most notably R95, "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome" and X40-X49, "Unintentional poisoning." Caution should be used in
    interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#New-Jersey-Reporting-Anomalies.
    4. Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, "Other
    ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in
    interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#California-Reporting-Anomalies.
    5. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality.
    6. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable.
    7. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2000 Standard Population.
    8. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted Rates.
    9. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates.
    10. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the
    funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis
    of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin
    are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Racial Differences.
    11. The method used to calculate 95% confidence intervals is documented here: More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Confidence-Intervals.
    12. The method used to calculate standard errors is documented here: More information:
    http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Standard-Errors.
    13. The population figures for year 2018 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2018
    postcensal series released by NCHS on June 25, 2019. The population figures for year 2017 are bridged-race estimates of the July
    1 resident population, from the Vintage 2017 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 27, 2018. The population figures for
    year 2016 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2016 postcensal series released by NCHS
    on June 26, 2017. The population figures for year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the
    Vintage 2015 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016. The population figures for year 2014 are bridged-race
    estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2014 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 30, 2015. The
    population figures for year 2013 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 postcensal
    series released by NCHS on June 26, 2014. The population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident
    population, from the Vintage 2012 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are
    bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18,
    2012. Population figures for 2010 are April 1 Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race
    estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on
    October 26, 2012. Population figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999
    intercensal series of July 1 estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births.
    <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to
    use of the population estimates which were available at the time of release.
    14. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the
    resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group.
